**Sloth** is a liteweight highly available monitoring and alerting system. It comes with three roles:
 * `Agent Role`: Runs health checks on hosts.
 * `Worker Role`: Updates agents state, health checks and alerting. The elected leader watches if agents up or down.
 * `API Role`: A REST service to interact with the cluster & collect metrics.

**Sloth** uses RabbitMQ as default message broker and etcd as a data storage and for leader election (electing the leader worker). It is still an experimental project so use at your own risk.
